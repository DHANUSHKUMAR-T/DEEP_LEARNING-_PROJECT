# TASK-2(DEEP_LEARNING-_PROJECT(Functional Image Classification and NLP Models with PyTorch)

**1)IMPLEMENT A DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR IMAGE CLASSIFICATION OR NATURALLANGUAGE PROCESSING USINGTENSORFLOW OR PYTORCH**

**2)DELIVERABLE: A FUNCTIONAL MODEL WITH VISUALIZATIONS OF RESULTS.**
#
**ðŸ“˜ Description**

This project implements deep learning models for two major tasks: Image Classification and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Leveraging the power of TensorFlow and PyTorch, the models are designed to provide high accuracy and efficiency while being easy to customize for various datasets and applications. The project also includes detailed visualizations of results to aid understanding and analysis.

 #
 
 **âœ¨ Features**
 
*Dual Focus: Support for both Image Classification and NLP tasks.

*Framework Flexibility: Compatible with both TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks.

*Visualization Tools: Clear and interactive visualizations for model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, loss).

*Preprocessing Pipelines: Automated data preprocessing for both images and text.

*Customizability: Modular design to accommodate different datasets and hyperparameter tuning.

*Documentation: Well-documented code with examples for seamless implementation.

#

**These are the commands for deep learning, and here the NLP is used**
#
**For analyzing images of animals, objects, or any other subjects, simply use the command:
analyze <image_file_name>**

test_image.jpg

This will process the provided image and generate a descriptive caption, giving you a quick summary of whatâ€™s captured.
#
**For real-time image capture and analysis using the camera, you can use the command:
capture**

The assistant will instantly capture a photo and provide a caption, making it easier to identify and describe objects or scenes on the spot.
